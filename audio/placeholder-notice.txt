MP3 Files Required

To enable background music in the game, you need to download the MP3 files.

Option 1: Run the download_tracks.js script with Node.js:
  node download_tracks.js

Option 2: Download these files manually and save them in this directory:

If no MP3 files are available, the game will use synthesized music as a fallback.
